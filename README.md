- 👀 I’m interested in Flutter, Competitive Coding(trying it out at the moment so don't know if it will stick or not).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning even more flutter cause i cannot get enough of it :) + some advanced dsa for getting more efficient at stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new technologies specifically related to Flutter and similar kind of future technologies, if there are any or would be.
